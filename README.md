# lowRamChecker
Simple script to check if Linux free memory is low and warn you or kill a process.

I use this script on a low RAM linux box which totally dies when using too many chrome tabs. (Something going wrong
with chrome supposedly suspending its tabs when system RAM is low.)

Anyway this script stops my whole system grinding to a halt.

Can check when either free memory is low or memory usage reaches your installed RAM amount.
